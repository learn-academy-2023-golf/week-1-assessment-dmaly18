// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.
// There is no need to change any of the code.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
//const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
//console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer: 5
// b) Verify and explain: My answer was correct because when push was called on it added indigo to the string adding a 5th data type.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

//const cohort = "LEARN 2023"

// a) Your answer:9
// b) Verify and explain: The correct answer was 10 I did not include the space inside the string.

// --------------------2) What will this log?

//const greeting = "Hello World!"
//console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: o

// --------------------3) What will this log?

//const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
//const index = 1
//console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Ruby
// b) Verify and explain: calling on a index the count starts at zero putting Ruby in spot 1 inside the string.

// --------------------4) What will this log?

//const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
//console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer:"SATURDAY", "SUNDAY"
// b) Verify and explain: I got the answer wrong, code came up as error the terminal is saying toUpperCase is not a function.

// --------------------5) What will this log?
