# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: value is the contents inside of an array, and the index is where it is located.

Researched answer: The first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on - and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Unsure

The difference between arrays and strings is that an array is a data structure that holds a collection of elements having the same data types, while a string is a collection of characters.

Researched answer: Data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function

2. Jest: A JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

3. Objects: an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of key value pairs.
